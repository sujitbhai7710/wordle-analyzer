                  The luck rating tells you whether the clue pattern you received was more or less helpful than average. When you make a guess in Wordle, the feedback you get can vary dramatically depending on the actual answer. Sometimes a guess eliminates 90% of possibilities (lucky!), and sometimes it barely narrows things down (unlucky). Our analyzer calculates the expected average number of remaining answers for your guess across all possible solutions, then compares it to your actual result. A &quot;lucky&quot; rating means your clue eliminated significantly more words than expected, while &quot;unlucky&quot; means it eliminated fewer. This is not a judgment on your word choice — it is simply measuring the random variance in how helpful the feedback happened to be.

                  Guess quality measures how effectively your word choice narrowed down the possible answers, independent of luck. It is calculated as the ratio of words eliminated to the total words that could have been eliminated. A high guess quality means your word was excellent at partitioning the remaining possibilities, regardless of which answer was actually correct. This metric helps you understand whether your strategic word selection was sound, even if the particular feedback you received was not the most helpful. A guess quality above 80% is considered excellent, while below 40% suggests there may have been better word choices available. Remember that guess quality is contextual — what makes a good guess depends heavily on how many possible answers remain and what you already know.

                  The AI recommendation shows you the mathematically optimal word you could have played at each turn. Our algorithm uses information theory to evaluate every possible guess, calculating which word would maximize the expected reduction in uncertainty. The key insight is that the best guess is not always a word that could be the answer — sometimes a word you know is wrong provides more information by testing multiple letter positions simultaneously. The AI considers all possible clue patterns a guess could produce and chooses the word that creates the most balanced distribution of remaining answer counts. When the AI recommendation matches your actual play, it means you independently chose the optimal strategy. When it differs, comparing the two can reveal strategic insights you can apply in future games.

                <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                  Your first guess sets the tone for the entire game. Words like SLATE, CRANE, or TRACE are excellent openers because they contain the most common letters in Wordle answers (S, T, A, E, R, N). These letters appear in the majority of five-letter English words, so testing them early gives you the most information. Avoid starting with unusual letters like Q, X, Z, or J — while they might feel clever, they rarely appear in Wordle answers and waste a valuable guess. See our <Link href="/tools/best-words" className="text-[#6aaa64] hover:underline">full ranking of the best Wordle starting words</Link> for data-driven recommendations.

                <h3 className="font-semibold text-sm">2. Test Vowels Early</h3>
                <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                  Most Wordle answers contain two or three vowels. If your opener reveals one vowel, your second guess should test the remaining common vowels (A, E, I, O, U). For example, if your first guess reveals an A but no E, a word like RISEN or OATER can quickly identify which other vowels are present. Knowing the vowel profile of the answer dramatically narrows the possibilities. Our <Link href="/tools/letter-frequency" className="text-[#6aaa64] hover:underline">letter frequency tool</Link> shows you exactly which letters appear most often.

                <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                  A common mistake is to immediately try to solve around green letters. While it is tempting to build words using your confirmed letters, this often leads to narrow thinking. Instead, consider using your second or third guess to eliminate more possibilities, even if it means not using all your green letters. A guess that eliminates 80% of remaining words is better than a guess that might solve it but leaves 50% if wrong.

                <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                  Wordle answers follow English language patterns. Common endings include -IGHT words: LIGHT, NIGHT, FIGHT, RIGHT, MIGHT, SIGHT, TIGHT. Common starting letters include S, C, B, T, P, F, and M. Position your guesses to test these patterns when you have partial information.

                <h3 className="font-semibold text-sm">5. Handle Duplicates Carefully</h3>
                <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                  Duplicate letters are one of the trickiest aspects of Wordle. About 7% of Wordle answers contain a repeated letter (like LLAMA, SIZES, or GUESS). When you get a yellow letter, do not forget it might appear twice in the answer. If you have confirmed a letter is present but cannot find its correct position, consider that it might appear in multiple positions. Testing for duplicates when you are stuck can save you from wasting guesses.

                <h3 className="font-semibold text-sm">6. Use Elimination Strategically</h3>
                <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                  When you are down to a few possibilities, do not guess randomly. Instead, choose a word that distinguishes between the remaining options, even if it is not one of the possible answers. For example, if the answer could be BATCH, CATCH, HATCH, MATCH, PATCH, or WATCH, guessing a word like CHAMP would test multiple possibilities at once. Our <Link href="/blog/wordle-elimination-science" className="text-[#6aaa64] hover:underline">guide to the science of elimination</Link> covers this technique in depth.
